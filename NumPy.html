NumPy
-----
1.It is one of the multidimensional array
2.Why do we use numpy over list
   ->numpy is very fast
   ->firstly if 5 is to be stored,them first it is converted to binary and it can be formed with int32 and int16 and int8,but whereas in lists there will be a       built in integer type,it consists of size,refernce count,object type,objcet value.This int type requires more space for lists.
   ->faster to read less bytes of memory
   ->no type checking when iterating through objects
   ->NumPy occupies contiguous memory,Single instruction multiple data so in one computations only all the operations are done
   ->NumPy uses cache properly

****Numpy should have equal nested list elements
****List can have any no of netsed elments
